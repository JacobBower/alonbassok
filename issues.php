	<h2>Issues</h2>
    <p>Our community is a city of opportunity, one that draws people with the promise of good jobs and abundant beauty.  
              However, we must take action now to ensure our city remains livable for the working families who are already here, 
              and for our children.  As a resident of West Seattle, a transportation and urban planner, and former manager of 
              several small businesses, I will be your voice on the city council to ensure that our growing prosperity does not 
              leave current residents behind.</p>

              <p>Seattle is a city of neighborhoods, each with a unique character and rich traditions. We know, and must accept, 
              that our community is growing. And while this growth brings opportunity, we must make the most of this opportunity 
              while ensuring that we protect the character of each of these neighborhoods, so they remain great places for all people
			  and businesses to thrive.</p>

              <h3>HOUSING</h3>
              <p>Housing prices are driving many workers, artists, and students away from the city.  This is not acceptable. 
              As a city councilmember, I propose that all new developments in urban centers must include 20% affordable units--truly 
              affordable units. These need to support the people who need housing the most: people earning our city’s new $15 
              minimum wage--people earning $31,200 per year, which is roughly a third of Seattle’s median family income.</p>

              <p>Growth in our centers keeps development pressure away from the single-family areas in our city. And, growth in 
              centers allows people to live closer to jobs, and closer to the buses and trains that have good service and can get 
              them to their jobs.  With more housing in the centers, fewer people will be forced to drive, freeing up roadway for those
		      that do drive.</p>

    		<h3>TRANSPORTATION</h3>	
 		      <p>Seattle is growing in every way, except in new land. This demands our transportation system to become more efficient. 
              To improve transit, the city must work with the county and Sound Transit to eliminate bottlenecks and chokepoints through 
              a combination of design, technology, and dedication of street space. In key corridors, especially for the RapidRide and 
              services that connect villages and centers, we should find ways to add bus-only lanes.</p>
              
              <p>As a city we should be bold in exploring new ways of reducing delays, reducing conflicts, and improving safety for all. 
              However, Seattle has unique challenges, and anyone promising all easy answers is selling snake oil. Therefore we must be 
              willing to take chances—sometimes a low-cost, low-risk experiment is better than long debates, costly studies, and committing 
              to something wrong. Some proven solutions exist that Seattle can and should adopt.</p>
              
              <p>We need to get back to what we used to do right. Twenty years ago, Seattle embarked on an immense neighborhood planning 
              process. We should return to it. As a city, we should go back to asking all of our neighbors what their dreams are for their 
              neighborhoods and how the city’s policies can reflect and support those dreams.</p>
              
              <p>My hopes for our city are big. Everyone should be able to live and move around our city. Getting started, my solutions are 
              simple and can be implemented quickly—require affordable housing in urban centers and villages, dedicate right of way for buses, 
              and return to stronger neighborhood planning. All that is needed is the will to make it possible.</p>
