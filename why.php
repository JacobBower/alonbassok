	<h2>Why I'm Running</h2>
    <div id="content-left">	
 		      <p>A decade ago, when the city council had a vacancy, I was one of the nearly one hundred applicants
               that made their case to be considered. I’ve grown a lot in this past decade--gained a doctorate, professional
               experience, and a couple of smart daughters… But, what has not changed at all in this time were the problems
               our city faces and my belief in the solutions necessary to fix them. Back in 2005 I made my pitch for 
               affordable housing and better transit--today, I am making the same case.</p>
                 
              <p>When I first came to Seattle in 1997 I met many people who later moved elsewhere because of how expensive 
              renting an apartment or a house was. Later, as many of them that had stayed in Seattle started thinking about 
              coupling and settling down, they left town to go places where they could afford to buy a home.</p>
              
              <p>My wife Beverly and I bought our modest home in Delridge in 2006. We moved to Delridge because we had 
              gotten to know the neighborhood, some of the people that live here, loved the idea of living next to Longfellow 
              Creek, being in West Seattle, and so close to downtown. And, because we could afford it.</p>
              
              <p>I was fortunate to be able to spend five years studying jazz bass at the University of Michigan. Here 
              in Seattle, I have had the great pleasure of playing with many wonderful musicians. I’ve also met many wonderful 
              friends through my years of running restaurants in Queen Anne and Ballard. I know from speaking with my 
              musician and restaurant friends just how hard it is for them to stay here. Rents continue to climb. Things are 
              tough all around.</p>
              
              <p>A West Seattle neighbor who lives in Highland Park was recently sharing her story with me. She is a 
              single-mother of a middle schooler. She is being forced out of the home she rents because it was sold. 
              The whole block of houses that were in a state of disrepair is slowly turning into new, more expensive homes. 
              She is struggling to find a place for her, her son, and their pets. Her family is under a lot of stress. 
              Things are expensive, one needs good credit. As she put it to me:</p> 
              
              <div id="blockquote">“I think they just want us all to move further south and take the light rail in to serve the upper 
              classes but live on the margins in unsafe areas. F$@! em as long as they show up to serve our food..."</div>

              <p>After I left music school I came to Seattle and received a degree in economics from the University of Washington. 
              I focused on labor economics and focused how to better the connect low-wage jobs, with affordable housing--they are 
              not in the same place. And today, our de facto solution to affordable housing is to have people live in Renton and 
              Tacoma and commute to our city.</p> 
              
              <p>With this interest at heart I went on to get my Masters in Urban Planning. I focused on ways to design transit systems 
              that would help get people between home and work. But, this is not the right approach. No. The people that can afford to 
              spend the least of their time and money on travelling around are the ones that need to use the systems, while others benefit 
              from having their services. When I went on to my PhD, I studies our urban centers. They are wonderful places--different, 
              vibrant, exciting, with a lot of potential. And, if EVERYONE had the potential to live in them and use the good transit system 
              that serves them we would ALL be better off. Less people on the roads needing to drive. More well-rounded communities..</p>
              
              <p>Late one evening when I was three years old, my grandmother came in to say goodbye to me. She needed to catch the last bus 
              home. For many years after, she reminded me that I responded by saying that she didn’t need to leave, she could simply take a 
              taxi later. I've been thinking about transportation ever since then.</p>
              
              <p>In our modern world we have uber and other solutions in addition to taxis. But in seattle we still don't have an efficient, 
              world class transit system.</p>
              
              <p>I want Seattle to be a place where we can all live and get around easily. I don’t want any more of my friends and neighbors 
              to leave because it is too difficult for them to stay here.</p> 
              
              <p>We need to decide what we want Seattle to be when it grows up. The time is now.</p>
