		The streetcars would not cross the ship canal, saving enough money in bridge and tunnel construction to bring the price down, in Roderick and Bassok’s estimation, 
        to $1 billion for 75 to 100 miles of streetcar rail. After the system is built, ongoing maintenance would be funded by an employee hours tax, known derisively as a head tax.

        Bicyclists may also oppose streetcars because of the potential for road bike wheels to get caught in tracks. This is easily avoided by ensuring bike lanes are provided parallel to 
        streetcar tracks or, as Roderick and Bassok call for, giving streetcars exclusive lanes. At intersections Seattle already paints bikes lanes across streetcar tracks at right angles.

        Yesterday Roderick, who's running for citywide council position 8, and another candidate, Alon Bassok, who's running for citywide position 9, announced a joint pitch for a "neighborhood 
        municipal rail system." The plan proposes 100 miles of rail over the next 10 years, funded by property taxes of about $200 a year for the average Seattle homeowner.

        Two Seattle City Council candidates are proposing that the city pay for its own light-rail system. John Roderick and Alon Bassok say the Seattle-only system 
        would connect the city’s neighborhoods to each other and complement the regional light-rail system that Sound Transit began building more than a decade ago.

        Bassok says the Spring District is missing the chance to do something exceptional. The development won’t include anything that working families like that could 
        afford. Instead, the developer will pay into a fund to develop affordable housing outside the Spring District. "So you’re propagating essentially this area of 
        poor people and an area of rich people," Bassok says." As opposed to what would make it more convenient would be to have everybody living in one place and not 
        having to make that commute."

        "We just really are a fast growing city without enough inventory on the market," said Alon Bassok, a research scientist at the Runstad Center for Real Estate 
        Research at the University of Washington. "Limited inventory, in this case, means to me that we're going to see prices go up even further."

        For Bae and fellow researcher Alon Bassok, that growth represents a missing link between the health profession and city planners. "These are bigger land use 
        regulation issues", Bassok said. "Talk to people who have an impact on this and you ll find that they re not aware of it."
