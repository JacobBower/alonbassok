              “I have been friends with Alon Bassok over the past 15 + years and have enjoyed many discussions on urban planning and other policy 
              related topics with him. We often find ourselves discussing the lack of planning and vision at the City of Seattle. Over the years 
              Alon and I have both thought about running for City Council, but for various reasons the timing has been wrong, until now. I am happy 
              to offer my support to Alon. <b>His background in Urban Planning, coupled with his balanced views on growth and human service needs make 
              him an excellent candidate.</b>”

              for over 20 years. His decisions are driven by reason and truth, not partisanship. If voted in, Alon will not disappoint."

              "Alon is exactly the kind of voice we need in Seattle. He is <b>articulate, educated and knowledgeable</b> about the needs of the City’s infrastructure. He is also a loving and committed father of 2 young children so understands the needs from a family’s perspective too. And to top it all off he is witty, a sense of humor is desperately needed among our leaders, not that it is not serious work, but sometimes having a light hearted moment can help reconnect everyone to the importance of the work and why you are all doing what you are doing, working to improve the quality of living for the people of this great City of Seattle.

              transportation crises that have ballooned out of control."

              "With the unchecked growth that Seattle is currently experiencing there is an ever increasing need for voices in city government 
              who represent the people and policies which are being squeezed out by the developers more focused on short term gains . Our city 
              needs leaders with a clearer vision to the future, maintaining our communities as affordable and livable while not holding onto 
              archaic urban models. <b>Alon Bassok, with his background in urban planning and transportation, the arts, as well as his experience 
              living in several other urban areas, offers a potent combination of knowledge, perspective, candor and wit that would be well 
              utilized in our current political climate.</b>"
